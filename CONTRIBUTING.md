4) Open a PR with a clear description.

## Guidelines
- Keep changes focused and small.
- Update docs when public APIs change.
- Add tests when behavior changes.
- Prefer simple interfaces over heavy abstractions.

## Reporting Issues
- Include repro steps, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
- Add logs or stack traces when possible.
