## Current Initiative: mono-parity-context
- [x] Design optional, pluggable context budgeting + compaction + truncation modules.
- [x] Define minimal interfaces for model limits + usage reporting.
- [x] Provide seamless integration example for agent loop usage.

- [x] Add loop helper, adapter utilities, history hook, and context compatibility.
